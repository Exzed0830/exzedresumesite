						<p>I think one of the most important skills someone can have is problem solving. All it takes is a little persistance and curiosity but it can be suprisingly dificult to stay with a problem long enough to solve it. Over the last few years I have encountered a lot of obstacles that I have had to overcome which have greatly increased my ability to problem solve.

            Here is my experience with various programming languages and CS topics.

                Python was one of the first programming languages I used for personal projects, probably my largest project to date is a organization program that runs on a raspberry pi and does everything from LMS requests for school to do lists to calendar and daily reminders being displayed on a small screen.

                I've only used Java for about two years and completed AP Computer Science A which primarily focuses on Java skills. I also assisted in programming our Robot for the First Robotics Competition which is almost entirely in Java. My largest project in Java that I did without help from others was a basic GUI Email client.

                HTML and CSS the first kind of &quot; programing&quot; I ever did, starting with messing around in chrome debugging windows I learned the basics of web design and working my way up to bigger projects I am very comfortable with these markup languages.

                I know a limited amout of C++ from  taking Intro To C++ and Programmable Electronics and Robotics in High School as well as lots of Arduino Projects over the years. My most complicated project in C++ is an IOT button that wirelessly transmitts to a stepper motor and can be used for various purposes but was origanally intended to be used as a cheap remote toilet flusher for disabled people who are sensitive to loud noises.

                I started using linux when I installed Ubuntu on a dying iMac and it started running 10x better so I started daily driving Ubuntu on my personal laptop. Since then I have continued to use Linux on all my personal computers and have used various distributions including Ubuntu, Zorin OS, Elementary OS, Kali, Arch, and most recently Garuda.
